Apart from the usual cough clinic, breathing difficulties, pleural disease and difficult to manage respiratory symptoms, he had developed his niche expertise in Interventional Pulmonology, dealing with central airway emergencies like tumour obstruction, foreign body aspiration, benign tracheal stenosis, and endo-bronchial procedures such as electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound, and trans-bronchial cryo-lung biopsy.</p><p>Patient encounter with Dr Aziz often led to satisfying consultation due to his jovial and laid-back nature. He is very approachable, easy to work with and very resourceful in difficult-to-diagnose/-manage cases. Despite his casual approach, he is very sharp in making sure patients received the most optimum approach at arriving to a diagnosis and disease management.</p><p>After years of clinical experiences, Dr Aziz joined Gleneagles Kuala Lumpur as a resident Pulmonologist and Internal Medicine specialist consultant. </p>",

        "Recommendation": "<p>Board-certified Consultant Plastic and Laser Surgeon Dr Charles Lee graduated from the University of Mysore in 1976. He was conferred a Fellow of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Ireland in 1984. Dr Lee did his Postgraduate Plastic Surgery fellowship training at the Bangour General Hospital, Edinburgh, Scotland; Addenbrooke&rsquo;s Hospital, Cambridge and Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, England. He was subsequently gazetted as a Clinical Specialist in Plastic &amp; Reconstructive Surgery by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia in 1987 and worked at the General Hospital, Kuala Lumpur. </p>\n<p>In 1989, Dr Lee was appointed by the Ministry of Health to establish the first Department of Plastic &amp; Reconstructive Surgery at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) in Sabah. He also established the first Burns Unit at QEH and developed the Unit to become the primary Burns Referral Centre in Sabah. He was elected as the Vice-President of the Malaysian Association of Plastic, Aesthetic and Craniomaxillofacial Surgeons (MAPACS) in 2003-2005 and continues to be a current member of the association. </p>\n<p>In 2008, Dr Lee received the prestigious Pinnacle Award by Thermage USA as the highest Thermage user for Facial Contouring in Malaysia, a further testimony of his passion for Aesthetics and Body Contouring. In 2010, Dr Lee is credited as the first plastic surgeon to bring the high-tech EndoVenous Laser Ablation treatment (EVLA) for varicose veins to the state of Sabah. His interest in this subspeciality led to the launching of the first Public Venous Disease Awareness Campaign in Sabah called &lsquo;Jom Scan Kaki&rsquo; which includes free duplex ultrasound scanning of the lower limbs for varicose veins. </p>\n<p>In 2011, he was awarded the Certificate of Achievement for Good Clinical Practice by the Clinical Research Centre, Ministry of Health, Malaysia. He was subsequently appointed as the Principal Investigator for the first clinical trial in Malaysia to determine the efficacy of Autologous Cultured Fibroblast Cells as a treatment for patients with facial contour defects thereby actively contributing to clinical research in Malaysia. </p>\n<p>In 2015, Dr Lee founded a charity community initiative called &lsquo;CLAP for Joy&rsquo; to provide excellence in well-timed surgical care, dentition, hearing, speech and language development for underprivileged Cleft Lip and Palate (CLAP) children born in Sabah from infancy to adulthood. A visionary project that has been well received by the public. Dr Lee has been a Consultant Plastic &amp; Cosmetic Surgeon for 30 years. His brand &lsquo;Just Get Gorgeous- Where Radiance Becomes Personal&rsquo; continues to embrace the concept of Beauty, Science and Experience. He looks forward to establishing the first Aesthetic Plastic Surgery &amp; Medical Spa at Gleneagles Kota Kinabalu, a One-Stop Center for Medical Aesthetics and Cosmetic Enhancement. Dr Charles Lee is a pioneer with a difference. His websites include: www.sabahplasticsurgery.com</p>",

        "Recommendation": "<p>Dr. Khoo earned his degree in Medicine at National University of Malaysia (UKM) in 1999 and later obtained his Master's degree in Orthopaedic Surgery at University Malaya in 200g. He was then posted to Penang General Hospital. He then pursued advanced orthopaedic trauma and completed his AO Fellowship at Geneva University Hospital, Switzerland in 2009.</p><p>At the time, there was a shortage of spine surgeons in Penang Hospital that propelled Dr. Khoo&rsquo;s determination to take up the challenge to train as one. He completed the 3-year Subspecialty Training Programme under the Ministry of Health, where he was a fellow in various distinguished spine centres, notably Sarawak General Hospital, University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland and Schoen Klinikum in Munich, Germany. He also pursued a travelling fellowship under the Asia Pacific Spine Society at renown spine centre in Bangkok and Singapore.</p><p>Upon returning from his training Dr. Khoo led the Spine Unit in Penang General Hospital. This gave him the opportunity to treat a vast variety of spinal disorders from the commonest spinal trauma to the complex spinal deformity corrective surgeries. His role as a senior orthopaedic surgeon at Penang General Hospital has helped him forge a strong base in complex trauma surgery as well as various orthopaedic surgeries.</p><p>Since joining Gleneagles Penang in 2016, Dr. Khoo has pursued special interest in minimal invasive spinal surgery (MISS) and endoscopic spine surgery. He attended attachments at Wooridul Spine Hospital and Teun Tuen Hospital in South Korea to learn directly from the experts in the field.&nbsp;</p>",

Rheumatology service was almost non-existence in most parts of Malaysia back in those days. The determination to help this group of patients has inspired Dr. Tan to pursue to subspecialty training in rheumatology in 2002. </p>\n<p>Married and blessed with a daughter, Dr. Tan finds work-family-life balance by reading, jogging and hiking. As a way of giving back to society, she contributes to local and international charity organisations and NGOs, in the form of monetary or giving free medical talks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
