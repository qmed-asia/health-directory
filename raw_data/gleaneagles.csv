<p>Prior to joining private practice in 2017, &nbsp;Dr Tan Bee Eng served as a senior Consultant Rheumatologist and the Head of Rheumatology Unit in Penang General Hospital (PGH).&nbsp; </p>
<p>Dr Tan graduated with M.D. (UKM) from National University of Malaysia in 1997 and obtained physician qualification from Royal College of Physician of United Kingdom (MRCP UK) in 2001.&nbsp; She spent four additional years of rheumatology training in various hospitals in Malaysia and Tan Tock Seng Hospital (Singapore) before credentialed as a Consultant Rheumatologist by Ministry of Health Malaysia in December 2005.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr Tan has published scientific papers in many prestigious peer-review medical journals, as well as posters in local and international meetings.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was a development committee of the first Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines in Rheumatoid Arthritis (2017) and Osteoarthritis (2011).&nbsp; She is instrumental in developing PGH as one of the biggest tertiary referral centre for rheumatology service in Malaysia.&nbsp; A certified trainer for Malaysia Rheumatology Fellowship Program, she has nurtured many enthusiastic young doctors into good rheumatologists.</p>
<p>Dr. Tan&rsquo;s interest in rheumatology sprouted in her early career as a Medical Officer and Junior Physician.&nbsp; She encountered many young female patients who suffered disability and death due to difficult autoimmune rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic vasculitides. Rheumatology service was almost non-existence in most parts of Malaysia back in those days. The determination to help this group of patients has inspired Dr. Tan to pursue to subspecialty training in rheumatology in 2002. </p>
<p>Married and blessed with a daughter, Dr. Tan finds work-family-life balance by reading, jogging and hiking. As a way of giving back to society, she contributes to local and international charity organisations and NGOs, in the form of monetary or giving free medical talks.</p>
